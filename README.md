File to start project: Main.java in default package
Files to test project: All classes in test and test.french packages. ParserTests in model package.
Files required by project: Properties files in model.resources package, images in view.display package, and JGame
Caveats with program: Undo and redo only undoes and redoes turtle commands. Onmove seems to register too fast for the program to keep up, so it overloads the program at times.
